Service Automate is a collection of modern UI components and website templates built on top of React, and soon, Vue. With Tailwind CSS, the components are beautifully designed and expertly crafted, allowing you to build beautiful websites.

## Why Service Automate?

Service Automate is fully free and open source. You don't need to pay anything to use it, and we are working on it full-time, so we'll keep improving and adding more UIs. If youâ€™re working on a large project that requires a high level of UI customization or you find yourself repeating the same UI patterns across projects, consider creating an internal UI library. In this case, Service Automate is a great choice. You should definitely use it.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed the latest version of npm/yarn/pnpm.
